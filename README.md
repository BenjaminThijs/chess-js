# chess-js

Just chess in Javascript.
Now with actuall classes :)

## FAQ (but not really)

### Why did I decide to make this?

Because I can. (And because I needed a js-project for school)

### What will it be used for?

Mainly to play against an AI.

### What are the AI specs?

Non-existant at the moment :)
I will just use some pre-made AI-model once the actual engine is working.
Eventually I will make my own AI, but that will still take some time most likely.

### Will you take this seriously?

Hell no.

### Will we be able to ask help when it breaks?

Yes, if you give me money :)

### Are we allowed to use this project?

Yes, but only for educational purposes.
Jk, do whatever you want, I'm not your mom.

### Hotel?

Trivago.
